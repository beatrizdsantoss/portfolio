                            <h5>Goal:</h5>
                            <p>Gain customer insights and trends to predict product interactions and implement a finely targeted marketing stragety for one Bellabeat product.</p>
                            <h5>Analytics Business Task:</h5>
                            <p>Understand how users utilize non-Bellabeats smart devices based on logged data, activity, and steps.</p>
                            <h5>Limitations:</h5>
                            <p>A sampling bias is one major limitation from this dataset.
                                The survey relies on 33 participants which may possibly skew the results.
                                In addition, information about particpants weight goals and progression, age, and gender may aid valuable information that can create a more in-depth analysis.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Results/Suggestions:</h5>
                            <p>
                                Drawing insights from data unrelated to Bellabeat, there is a forecast that products designed for activity tracking may witness increased usage. 
                                These devices are employed not only for fitness purposes but also to monitor daily movements, as shown in the analysis of extended sedentary periods and a significant portion of participants engaging in low-volume steps.
                                Another notable trend is the increased activity logging in by users during weekdays, specifically from Tuesdays to Thursdays. 
                                This pattern suggests a significant user base consisting primarily of working individuals who engage with these smart devices.
                                An effective marketing strategy for the Bellabeat Health App involves delivering tailored messages to distinct user segments. 
                                Messages can be customized for users who rely on these smart devices for daily health monitoring and for those who prioritize fitness tracking. 
                                Additionally, the strategy should consider the days when users are most active in tracking their health information.
                                It should incorporate the implementation of timely reminders (particularly for weekends when users may forget) to encourage consistent activity logging.

                                Superstore Giant is a retail chain based across the United States that offers a variety of office supplies.

                            <h5>Goal:</h5>
                            <p>
                                Understand Superstore Giant products and customers for enhanced marketing strategies.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Analytics Business Task:</h5>
                            <p>
                                Discover and analyze what products, regions, categories, and customer segments Superstore Giant should target or avoid.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Limitations:</h5>
                            <p>Gathering additional customer data, including demographic information such as gender and age, can significantly enhance the depth and accuracy of the analysis.</p>
                            <h5>Results/Suggestions:</h5>
                            <p>
                                Based on the analysis, the Western region exhibits the highest number of orders, with individuals buying for personal purposes making up half of the customer segment, while corporations rank second in terms of the buyer segment.
                                A marketing strategy derived from this information will involve initially partnering with businesses, offices and school districts in the Western region to strengthen customer loyalty and expand Superstore's reach. 
                                Subsequently, we will extend collaborations to select companies and districts in other regions. 
                                These partnerships may involve providing supplies or offering discounts on specific products and on specific periods, like back-to-school season.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, considering that binders have the highest sales and paper ranks as the second-highest, it reveals a complementary relationship. 
                                Additionally, despite copiers having the highest profit margins while being the least ordered product, there exists a complementary relationship between copiers and paper. 
                                Introducing promotional offers where copiers are discounted with the purchase of papers or binders could potentially boost copier sales. 
                                Conversely, customers purchasing copiers may receive discounts on paper when buying at specified quantities.
